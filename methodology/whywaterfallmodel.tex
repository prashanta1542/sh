\section{Why Waterfall Model?}
The Waterfall model is often chosen when project requirements are well-defined and stable, and there is a clear understanding of the end goal. Its sequential nature allows for a structured and systematic approach, where each phase is completed before moving to the next. This model provides a clear project timeline, milestones, and deliverables, making it easier to manage and estimate project timelines. Additionally, the Waterfall model can be beneficial when working on projects with strict regulatory or compliance requirements, as it allows for thorough documentation and validation at each stage. However, it may be less suitable for projects with evolving or uncertain requirements, as it lacks flexibility for accommodating changes during the development process.
