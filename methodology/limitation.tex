\section{Limitation of Waterfall Model}
One limitation of the Waterfall model is its lack of flexibility in accommodating changes or evolving requirements during the software development process. Since each phase is dependent on the completion of the previous phase, it can be challenging to make modifications or incorporate feedback once a phase is completed. This rigidity can lead to delays and increased costs if changes are required later in the project.  Furthermore, testing is typically performed towards the end, which increases the risk of discovering issues or defects late in the development cycle.
